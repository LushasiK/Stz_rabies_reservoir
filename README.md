Data and scripts for "Reservoir Dynamics of Rabies in Southeast Tanzania and the roles of cross-species transmission and domestic dog vaccination‚Äù.
Identifying features such as names and GPS coordinates have been removed. 

The data files are described below:
1.	animal_bites: a list of biting animals with their unique identifier identified across the study areas.
2.	animal_cases_map: a list of animal rabies cases and their geographical coordinates indication the location of where they were identified.
3.	Case_numbers_all_areas: contains animal rabies cases from all areas across the study including northern Tanzania (Ngorongoro and Serengeti) and for Pemba Island
4.	Combined_animal_cases_ts: monthly cases of probable animal rabies 
5.	Combined_human_deaths_ts: monthly probable human deaths according to the species of animal that caused the exposure
6.	Combined_human_Exposure_ts: monthly probable human rabies exposures according to the species of animal that caused the exposure
7.	Dog_population_year: annual dog population estimate per ward
8.	human_bites:  human bite data traced over the study period
9.	human_exposures_prop: proportion of probable human rabies exposures by biting animal species
10.	STzCellData_4kmsq: 4kmsq grid cells of the study area with unique identifying number for each cell
11.	STzdog_pop_matrix: Dog population data matrix for the study site
12.	STzHumanPopMat_CellByMonth_2010-01-01_to_2020-12-31: Human population matrix for the study site in southern Tanzania from 2010 to 2020
13.	Vacc_coverage_summary_STzdists: Summary statistics of vaccination coverage by district across the study site

Figures that are generated from the scripts and data are provided in subfolder: *figs*                                                                        

Output files generated from the scripts and data are provided in subfolder: *output*

The subfolder *trees* contains scripts for the transmission tree analyses.

The subfolder *cases_and_species_proportion* contains scripts for the case proportions, logistic analysis, and human and animal population estimates.  The *GIS* folder within this has shapefiles for the study areas.

The *R* subfolder contains helper functions for the scripts
