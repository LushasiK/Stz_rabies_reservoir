Data and scripts for the Reservoir Dynamics of Rabies in Southeast Tanzania and the roles of cross-species transmission and domestic dog vaccination‚Äù for the manuscript submitted to *Journal of applied Ecology*

The data files are described below:
1.	animal_bites. Contains a list of biting animals with their unique identifier  identified across the study areas.
2.	animal_cases_map: Contains a list of animal rabies cases and their geographical coordinates indication the location of where they were identified.
3.	Case_numbers_all_areas: Contains animal rabies cases from all areas across the study include northern Tanzania (Ngorongoro and Serengeti) and for Pemba Island
4.	Combined_animal_cases_ts: Monthly cases of animal rabies data
5.	Combined_human_deaths_ts: Month human deaths data per species
6.	Combined_human_Exposure_ts:Monthly exposures of human data per animal species
7.	Dog_population_year: Contains annual dog population estimate per ward
8.	human_bites:  Total human bite data traced over the study period
9.	human_exposures_prop: Contains proportional of human exposures by animal species
10.	STzCellData_4kmsq: 4kmsq grid cells of the study area with unique identifying number for each cell
11.	STzdog_pop_matrix: Dog population data matrix for the study site
12.	STzHumanPopMat_CellByMonth_2010-01-01_to_2020-12-31: Human population matrix for the study site in southern Tanzania from 2010 to 2020
13.	Vacc_coverage_summary_STzdists: Summary statistics of vaccination coverage for the individual district across the study site

Figures that are generated from the scripts and data are provided in subfolder: *figs*                                                                        

Output files generated from the scripts and data are provided in subfolder: *output*

The subfolder trees contains scripts for the transmission tree analyses.

The subfolder, cases_and_species_proportion contains scripts for the case proportions, logistic analysis, human and animal population estimates.  The GIS folder within this subfolder has shape files  for the study areas.

Rsubfolder contains helper functions for the scripts
