9.	human_bites:  human bite data traced over the study period. The columns variables are: i) Attacking.Species - the species of the biting animal, ii) Rabid - whether the animal was considered likely to be rabid, iii) Bitter.

The column variables are: i) Year - the year during which the exposures occurred, ii) Species - the species responsible for the exposures, iii) Spec_Count - the number of exposures from that species reported in that year, iv) Total - the sum of all exposures by all species reported in that year, and v) Prop_of_cases - the proportion of the total exposures from that year that were caused by the particular species.
11.	NBS2012_MasterVillagePop_shpmatched.csv: census data reporting the human population by village, ward and district. The columns labelled shpDistrict, shpWard and shpVillage correspond to the names in an associated shapefile.
12.	Number_of_dogs24: Estimates of dog numbers. The column variables relevant to this study are: i) District - the district for which the dog number is being estimated, ii) Numdogs - the estimated number of dogs, iii) Numdogs.lwr - the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated number of dogs; and iv) Numdogs.upr - the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated number of dogs.
13.	seren_dists: Distances between known domestic dog rabies cases from Serengeti. Used for parameter estimation
14.	seren_si: Serial intervals of known domestic dog rabies cases from Serengeti. Used for parameter estimation. The column variables are: i) ID - the unique identifier of the animal case, ii) Biter_ID - the unique identifier of the biting animal iii) SS - the date symptoms started in an infected animal case, iv) SS_uncert - the uncertainty, in days, around the date of when symptoms started in an infected animal case, v) biter_SS - the date symptoms started  in the biting animal, vi) biter_SS_uncertainty - the uncertainty, in days, around the date symptoms started in the biting animal, and vii) Serial_Interval - the serial interval not incorporating any of the reported uncertainty.
